Purpose:      demonstrate examples of informative images and compliance to W3C WAI
Description:  

        https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/
        
        These tutorials provide best-practice guidance on implementing accessibility in different situations. This page combined the following WCAG success criteria and techniques from different conformance levels:

        Techniques:
        G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content
        H37: Using alt attributes on img elements
               
        Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. This ensures that images can be used by people with various disabilities. 
        informative images
        decorative images
        functional images
        images of text
        complex images
        groups of images
        image maps

            <h3>Example 1: Images used to label other information</h3>
            <p>For full tutorial, go to W3C WAI <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/#example-1-images-used-to-label-other-information" target="_blank">Informative Images</a>. This tutorial combines technizues G94 (Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content) and H37 (Using alt attributes on img elements).</p>

                     alt="Telephone:"> 0123 456 7890

                <img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/content-images/wai-tutorials/images/fax.png" 
                     alt="Fax:"> 0123 456 7891
            </p>   

            <h3>Example 2: Images used to supplement other information</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/content-images/wai-tutorials/images/dog.jpg" alt="Dog with a bell attached to its collar.">
                Off-duty guide dogs often wear a bell. Its ring helps the blind owner keep track 
                of the dog’s location
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong> If the text included an explanation of how the dog wears a bell, the image might be considered redundant and therefore decorative. As this isn’t mentioned in the text, the image is deemed to be informative.</p>
            
            <h3>Example 3: Images conveying succinct information</h3>
            <img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/content-images/wai-tutorials/images/counter-clockwise.jpg" 
                 alt="Push the cap down and turn it counter-clockwise (from right to left)">
            
            <h3>Example 4: Images conveying an impression or emotion</h3>
            <img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/content-images/wai-tutorials/images/family.jpg" alt="We’re family-friendly. ">
            
            <h3>Example 5: Images conveying file format</h3>
