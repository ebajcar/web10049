Description:  
    - grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern against which we can line up our design elements
    - grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each row and column. The gaps are commonly referred to as gutters.
    - this example contains a DIV classified as "container" which is a parent to seven (7) children DIVs
    
    Defining a grid
    - display: grid property transforms all the direct children of the container into grid items.
    - grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px adds three 200-pixel wide columns.
    
    Flexible grids with the fr unit
    - fr unit represents one fraction of the available space in the grid container to flexibly size grid rows and columns.
    - grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    - grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
    
    Gaps between tracks
    - column-gap for gaps between columns
    - row-gap for gaps between rows
    - gap as a shorthand for both
    
    Repeating track listings
    - grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    
    Implicit and explicit grids
    - Explicit grid is created using grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows.
    - tracks created in the implicit grid are auto sized, which in general means that they're large enough to contain their content
    - grid-auto-rows: 100px; makes all cells the same height; if content does not fit, it overflow the cell (overflow:auto; can be 
      added to the children rule)
      
    The minmax() function
    -  set a minimum and maximum size for a track, for example, minmax(100px, auto). The minimum size is 100 pixels, but the maximum 
       is auto, which will expand to accommodate more content. 
    
    As many columns as will fit
    -  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));

    <h2>Implicit vs explicit</h2>
    <p>Both examples have columns sized explicitly using <code>grid-template-columns</code> property<p>
    <p><code>grid-auto-rows: 100px;</code> /*  implicit grid tracks of row sizing */</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div>One</div>
        <div>Two</div>
        <div>Three </div>
        <div>Our 100-pixel tall tracks won't be very useful if we add content into those tracks that is taller than 100 pixels, in which case it would cause an overflow. It might be better to have tracks that are at least 100 pixels tall and can still expand if more content becomes added. </div>
        <div>Five</div>
        <div>Six</div>
        <div>Seven</div>
    </div>
    <p><del>grid-auto-rows: 100px;</del> By default, tracks created in the implicit grid are auto sized, which in general means that they're large enough to contain their content.</p>
