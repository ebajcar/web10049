Description:  
    - grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern against which we can line up our design elements
    - grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each row and column. The gaps are commonly referred to as gutters.
    - this example contains a DIV classified as "container" which is a parent to seven (7) children DIVs
    
    Defining a grid
    - display: grid property transforms all the direct children of the container into grid items.
    - grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px adds three 200-pixel wide columns.
    
    Flexible grids with the fr unit
    - fr unit represents one fraction of the available space in the grid container to flexibly size grid rows and columns.
    - grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    - grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
    
    Gaps between tracks
    - column-gap for gaps between columns
    - row-gap for gaps between rows
    - gap as a shorthand for both
    
    Repeating track listings
    - grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    
    Implicit and explicit grids
    - Explicit grid is created using grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows.
    - tracks created in the implicit grid are auto sized, which in general means that they're large enough to contain their content
    - grid-auto-rows: 100px; makes all cells the same height; if content does not fit, it overflow the cell (overflow:auto; can be 
      added to the children rule)
      
    The minmax() function
    -  set a minimum and maximum size for a track, for example, minmax(100px, auto). The minimum size is 100 pixels, but the maximum 
       is auto, which will expand to accommodate more content. 
    
    As many columns as will fit
    -  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
