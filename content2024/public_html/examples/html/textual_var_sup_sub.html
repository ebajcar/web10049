  <p>In physics, massâ€“energy equivalence is the principle that anything 
  having mass has an equivalent amount of energy and vice versa, with these 
  fundamental quantities directly relating to one another 
  by Albert Einstein's famous formula:<p>
  <p><var>E</var> = <var>mc</var><sup>2</sup>.</p>

  In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem, also known as Pythagoras' 
  theorem, is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the 
  three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square 
  whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is 
  equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. 
  This theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of 
  the sides a, b and c, often called the <q>Pythagorean equation</q>:<br>
  <p>
    <var>a</v><sup>2</sup> = 
      <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>c</var><sup>2</sup>

  Water is the chemical substance with chemical formula 
  H<sub>2</sub>O; 
  one molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to a 
  single oxygen atom.<sup>[24]</sup> 
  Water is a tasteless, odorless liquid at ambient temperature 
  and pressure.
