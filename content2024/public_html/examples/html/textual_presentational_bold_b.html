    <h3>Examples from HTML Living Standard)</h3>
    <p><strong>4.5.21 The b element</strong> represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in interactive text-driven software, or an article lede.</p>
    
 <pre class="language-html"><code>
    &lt;!-- shows a use of the b element to highlight key words without marking them up as important: -->
    &lt;p>The &lt;b>frobonitor&lt;/b> and &lt;b>barbinator&lt;/b> components are fried.&lt;/p>
    
    &lt;!-- objects in a text adventure are highlighted as being special by use of the b element -->
    &lt;p>	
        You enter a small room. Your &lt;b>sword&lt;/b> glows
        brighter. A &lt;b>rat&lt;/b> scurries past the corner wall.
    &lt;/p>
    
    &lt;!-- Another case where the b element is appropriate is in marking up the lede (or lead) sentence or paragraph. -->

<!--
The elements <b>, <i>, and <u> came about so people could write bold, italics, or underlined text 
    in an era when CSS was still supported poorly or not at all. They only affect presentation 
    and not semantics, are known as presentational elements and should no longer be used 
    [MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals], 
    because semantics is so important to accessibility, SEO, etc. The concept of italics isn't 
    very helpful to people using screen readers, or to people using a writing system other than 
    the Latin alphabet.
