   <p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. Read further

    <p><strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong> behaves much like other client/server protocols used on the Internet, such as SMTP for email and FTP for file transfer. Web browsers contact remote web servers and make requests on behalf of users. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.

    <p><strong>Secure HTTP (HTTPS)</strong> Many enhanced protocols provide everything from encryption to streaming video. These services are often managed by separate daemons, residing on the same physical server; HTTPS is handled by a daemon that understands the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol and listens for requests on TCP port 443.

    <p><strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</strong> is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. It is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) and Secure File Transfer Protocol(SFTP). Read further about
