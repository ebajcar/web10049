    <p title="defined by [MDN]">Web development can be characterized as an ecosystem, a complex system of interrelationships among living and nonliving elements of the environment. These activities can be envisioned at three broad levels.</p> 
    <ul>  
        <li>The <strong>foundational components</strong>, such as networking and protocols, operate out-of-sight and make everything work. </li>
        <li>The <strong>middle level</strong>, includes technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP, and constitutes web development. </li>
        <li>The <strong>top level</strong> entails such topics as security threats, search algorithms and advanced programming design. </li>
    </ul>

      In this course, we focus on part of the middle level, specifically on HTML and CSS technologies, it is important to understand each technology in context of the whole system and its relationships with the other technologies. Key technologies to master (many are covered in other courses within your program) include:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> (user interface)</li>	
        <li>Front-end languages (Javascript, EcmaScript, jquery)</li>	
        <li>Back-end languages (node.js, ruby, python, java, PHP)</li>	
        <li>Databases and web storage ( SQL, MySQL, sessions)</li>	
        <li>HTTP and REST (request, response, communication)</li>	
        <li>web application architecture (planning, design, integration)</li>
        <li>Git (version control)</li>
        <li>Basic algorithms and data structures (optimization and performance)</li>
