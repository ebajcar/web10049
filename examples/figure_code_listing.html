from https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element

A FIGURE element's contents are part of the surrounding flow. If the purpose of the page is to display the figure, for example a photograph on an image sharing site, the FIGURE and FIGCAPTION elements can be used to explicitly provide a caption for that figure. For content that is only tangentially related, or that serves a separate purpose than the surrounding flow, the aside element should be used (and can itself wrap a figure). For example, a pull quote that repeats content from an article would be more appropriate in an aside than in a figure, because it isn't part of the content, it's a repetition of the content for the purposes of enticing readers or highlighting key topics.
This example shows the FIGURE element to mark up a code listing.

  <a href="#l4">listing 4</a> we see the primary core interface API declaration.

<figure id="l4">
 <figcaption>Listing 4. The primary core interface API declaration.</figcaption>
 <pre><code>interface PrimaryCore {
 boolean verifyDataLine();
 undefined sendData(sequence&lt;byte> data);
 undefined initSelfDestruct();
}</code></pre>

<p>The API is designed to use UTF-8.</p>
