        <h2>Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
     <blockquote>The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).The DOM is one of the most-used APIs on the Web because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved and changed. Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event. DOM was not originally specifiedâ€”it came about when browsers began implementing JavaScript. This legacy DOM is sometimes called DOM 0. Today, the WHATWG maintains the DOM Living Standard.</p>

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>The DOM is a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The document can be further processed and the results of that processing can be incorporated back into the presented page.</p>
    
    <p>Elements in the DOM represent things &mdash; objects; that is, they have intrinsic meaning, also known as semantics. The HTMLElement interface holds the object's methods and attributes (properties).  </p>

    DOM is a mapping layout model for all HTML and a way for CSS and Javascript to get in there and do stuff. <span>Tim Wright</span> calls it <em>developer's best friend</em> (after you master it). DOM is not HTML, not CSS, and not Javascript! DOM is
      </p>
	<ul>	
		<li>the combinations of the elements you use <mark>(objects)</mark>, </li>
		<li>the order you choose to display them <mark>(model)</mark>, and</li>
		<li> the endless offerings of access points to modify any part of the overall structure <mark>(document)</mark> while navigating around with the various properties that CSS provides and the various methods Javascript provides. </li>
	</ul> 
    
<p>When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object. The document object is the root node of the HTML document and the "owner" of all other nodes.</p>
    <p>The HTML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating HTML documents. It presents an HTML document as a <dfn>tree structure</dfn> or a <dfn>hierarchy</dfn>.</p>
    
    <p>The DOM is a representation of the structure of our HTML page that you can interact with programmatically. An HTML document is a hierarchy of elements (objects). The browser produces an outline based on this hierarchy and displays it to the visitor (user). The browser constructs a DOM that can be used by the developer. The DOM's application programming interface (API) is exposed as objects with properties and methods, enabling you to write Javascript code to interact with HTML elements rendered to the page.</p>
    
    <p>Our ability to manipulate and create web pages consistently across formats comes from the document object model API. This API defines the order and structure of document files as well as how the file is manipulated to create, edit, or remove contents.</p>
