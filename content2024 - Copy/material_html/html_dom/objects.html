        <h2>Thinking in Objects</h2>
   <p class="text-base mb-2">The procedural paradigm focuses on designing methods. The object-oriented paradigm couples data and methods together into objects. Software design using the object-priented paradigm focuses on objects and operations on objects.</p>
    <p class="text-base mb-2">Objects are the fundamental building blocks of applications from an object-oriented perspective. An object is a self-contained component that contains properties and methods needed to make a certain type of data useful. An objectâ€™s properties are what it knows and its methods are what it can do.</p>
    <p class="text-base mb-2">An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified. An object has a unique identity, state, and behaviour. The state of an object, also known as its properties or attributes, is represented by data fields with their current values. The behaviour of an object, also known as its actions, is defined by methods. To invoke a method on an object is to ask the object to perform an action. Reference your Java textbook.</p>
    <p class="text-base mb-2">To design classes, you need to explore the relationships among classes. The common relationships among classes are association, aggregation, composition, and inheritance Inheritance enables you to define a general class and extend it to more specialized classes, called subclass, child class, or extended class. The existing class is called a superclass, parent class, or base class. Inheritance is a powerful feature for reusing software.</p>
