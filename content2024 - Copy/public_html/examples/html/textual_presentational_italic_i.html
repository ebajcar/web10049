<!--
The elements <b>, <i>, and <u> came about so people could write bold, italics, or underlined text 
    in an era when CSS was still supported poorly or not at all. They only affect presentation 
    and not semantics, are known as presentational elements and should no longer be used 
    [MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals], 
    because semantics is so important to accessibility, SEO, etc. The concept of italics isn't 
    very helpful to people using screen readers, or to people using a writing system other than 
    the Latin alphabet.
