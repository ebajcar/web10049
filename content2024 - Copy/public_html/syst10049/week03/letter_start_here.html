Description:
	marking up a letter @ MDN

For this project, our task is to mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. 
The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to the university.

Block/structural semantics:
***************************
DONE. You should structure the overall document with 
      an appropriate structure including doctype, and 
      <html>, <head> and <body> elements.

TODO. The letter in general should be marked up with a structure of paragraphs and headings, 
      with the exception of the below points. 

TODO. There is one top level heading (the "Re:" line) 
      and three second level headings.

TODO. The semester start dates, study subjects and exotic 
      dances should be marked up using an appropriate list type.

TODO. The two addresses can just be put inside paragraphs. 
      The <address> element is not appropriate for them — think about why. 
      In addition, each line of the addresses should sit on a new line, but not be in 
      a new paragraph. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address

Inline semantics:
*****************
TODO. The names of the sender and receiver (and "Tel" and "Email") 
      should be marked up with strong importance.

TODO. The four dates in the document should be given appropriate 
      elements containing machine-readable dates.

TODO. The first address and first date in the letter should be given a class attribute value 
      of "sender-column"; the CSS you'll add later will then cause these to be right aligned, 
      as should be the case in a classic letter layout.

TODO: The five acronyms/abbreviations in the main text 
      of the letter should be marked up to provide expansions of each acronym/abbreviation.

TODO. The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately
      — in the chemical formulae,  and the numbers 103 and 104 (they should be 10 to the power 
      or 3 and 4, respectively).

TODO: Try to mark up at least two appropriate words in the text with strong importance/emphasis.

TODO: There are two places where a hyperlink should be added; add appropriate links with titles. 
      For the location that the links point to, just use http://example.com.

TODO. The university motto quote and citation should be marked up with appropriate elements.

The head of the document:
*************************

TODO. The character set of the document should be specified 
      as utf-8 using an appropriate meta tag.

TODO. The author of the letter should be specified in an appropriate meta tag.

IGNORE FOR NOW
**************
    The provided CSS should be included inside an appropriate tag.
