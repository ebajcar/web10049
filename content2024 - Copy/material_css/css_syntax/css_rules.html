        <h2>CSS Rules</h2>
<div class="box">
 	<p style="font-size:1.2em">A CSS document is a series of style rules, which are a combination of:</p>
	<ul >
		<li><strong>qualified rules</strong> that apply styles to elements in a document, and</li>
		<li><strong>at-rules</strong>, which define special processing rules or values for the CSS document.</li>
	</ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Qualified rules</h3>	
	<p>A <strong>qualified</strong> rule starts with a prelude then has a {}-wrapped block containing a sequence of declarations. The meaning of the prelude varies based on the context that the rule appears in—for style rules, it’s a selector which specifies what elements the declarations will apply to. Each declaration has a name, followed by a colon and the declaration value. Declarations are separated by semicolons.</p>
	<p>A <strong>style rule</strong> is a qualified rule that associates a <strong>selector list</strong> with a list of <strong>property declarations</strong>. They are also called rule sets in [CSS2]. CSS Cascading and Inheritance [CSS-CASCADE-3] defines how the declarations inside of style rules participate in the cascade.</p>

       

    <h3>At-rules</h3>	       
	<p>At-rules are all different, but they have a basic structure in common. They start with an "@" symbol, followed by their name as a CSS keyword. Some at-rules are simple statements, with their name followed by more CSS values to specify their behavior, and finally ended by a semicolon. Others are blocks; they can have CSS values following their name, but they end with a {}-wrapped block, similar to a qualified rule. Even the contents of these blocks are specific to the given at-rule: sometimes they contain a sequence of declarations, like a qualified rule; other times, they may contain additional blocks, or at-rules, or other structures altogether.<br>
