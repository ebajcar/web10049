        <h2>Writing documentation and coding style</h2>

        <h3>Documenting code</h3>
        <p>Best practices always encourage you to document your code through the use of comments. A programmer might create a working program today, see it used for months or years, and then have to make changes to it. Programming languages are fairly cryptic, there are many of them, each with its own syntax and semantic differences, and if the program is complex, even the original author will struggle to understand what the code was meant to do. Comments provide the opportunity to describe, in plain text, what the program does and how it works.</p>      
        
        
        <h3>Writing code</h3>
        <p>Code must be neat and organized to be easy to read and easy to debug. Best practices include <strong>indentation</strong> and <strong>new line for each statement</strong>. Also note text editors provide syntax highlighting, indentation, line numbers, and mono-spaced font to make the code easier to read.</p>
        <p>When sharing code on paper or electronically (PDF), include line numbers, print single-line spacing, use mono-spaced font, preserve indentation, and color syntax (whenever possible). Every printed document must have header and footer, which provide author's name on every page, name of the document on every page, and page number (preferably in the format "Page X of Y" (especially for longer printouts).</p>   
        
        <h3>Using existing code</h3>
        <p><strong>Do not use any code you do not understand.</strong> Do not rely on copy and paste technique to complete your work.  If you are working with other people's code, make sure you document well what the code does, who created, where you found it, and what changes you made to it (if any).</p>
