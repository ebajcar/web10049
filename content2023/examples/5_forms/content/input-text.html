       Note that the input elements, regardless of length, always render as a single line.
       Describe the textarea element. Compare to input element, which attributes are same/different.
       Check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea
       How does the spellcheck attribute work? what values can you assign to it? Compare output 10 and 11. 
       Try adding (moving) the autofocus to 11. (or add content with spelling errors in both 10 and 11). 
       Try adding text to 12.  Describe your observations.
