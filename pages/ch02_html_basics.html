    <p>HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language. Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and even applications. Today, HTML is used to organize the text and other forms of information, that we want to present on the web.</p>
    <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
	<h5>Standards</h5>
	<p>Standards and guidelines assist in optimization for search engines and screen readers. HTML5 semantic elements provide the mechanisms necessary to structure the page more easily for accessibility via screen readers. Search engines take advantage of HTML5 semantics by using the article element to determine the purpose of the page.</p>

WAI develops its work through W3C’s consensus-based process, involving different stakeholders in web accessibility. These include industry, disability organizations, government, accessibility research organizations, and more. WAI, in partnership with organizations around the world, pursues accessibility of the web through these primary activities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ensuring that W3C standards support accessibility</li>
		<li>developing accessibility guidelines for web content and applications, browsers, and authoring tools</li>
		<li>developing resources to improve web accessibility evaluation processes and tools</li>
		<li>supporting education and outreach on web accessibility</li>
		<li>coordinating with research and development that may impact future accessibility of the web</li>
		<li>promoting harmonized international uptake of web accessibility standards</p>

		<figcaption>Elements, attributes, and attribute values in HTML are defined, in the specification, to have certain meanings (semantics).

	<h4 id="page03">Semantic correctness</h4>	
	<p>Semantic correctness means that all elements are chosen well. <strong>Semantics are front and center with HTML5</strong>, giving meaning to structure of web apps and dynamic web content. This semantic information is critical to assistive technologies. In some cases assistive technologies use semantic information to provide additional functionality. A speech recognition tool might provide a voice command for moving focus to the start of the main element for example. When the appropriate HTML element or attribute is not used, it deprives HTML processors of valuable semantic information. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#elements">W3C</a></p>
    <p title="from HTML text fundamentals (MDN)">Why do we need semantics? Semantics are relied on everywhere around us — we rely on previous experience to tell us what the function of an everyday object is; when we see something, we know what its function will be. So, for example, we expect a red traffic light to mean "stop", and a green traffic light to mean "go". Things can get tricky very quickly if the wrong semantics are applied (Do any countries use red to mean "go"? I hope not.) Read more at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals" target="_target">HTML text fundamentals (MDN)</a>.</p>	
		<p title="from Document and website structure (MDN)">In your HTML code, you can mark up sections of content based on their functionality — you can use elements that represent the sections of content  unambiguously. Assistive technologies like screenreaders can recognise those elements and help with tasks like "find the main navigation", or "find the main content." </p>
		<p>The consequences of not using the right element structure and semantics for the right job fails to give the content structure, so the browser does not know what is a heading and what is a paragraph. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content, often just reading the headings to begin with (we usually spend a very short time on a web page). If they can't see anything useful within a few seconds, they'll likely get frustrated and go somewhere else.</li>
			<li>Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings. Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</li>
			<li>Severely visually impaired people often don't read web pages; they listen to them instead. This is done with software called a screen reader. This software provides ways to get fast access to given text content. Among the various techniques used, they provide an outline of the document by reading out the headings, allowing their users to find the information they need quickly. If headings are not available, they will be forced to listen to the whole document read out loud.</li>
			<li>To style content with CSS, or make it do interesting things with JavaScript, you need to have elements wrapping the relevant content, so CSS/JavaScript can effectively target it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We therefore need to give our content structural markup. Read more at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure" target="_target">Document and website structure (MDN)</a>.</p>

	<h4 id="page04">Accessibility</h4>        
	<p>W3C develops international Web standards: HTML, CSS, and many more. W3C’s Web standards are called W3C Recommendations. All W3C standards are reviewed for accessibility support and their guidelines show how web accessibility depends on several components of web development and interaction working together, and how the WAI guidelines apply.</p>

	<h4 id="page06">Elements</h4>	
	<p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. Each element has a definition that includes the following information: categories, contexts in which this element can be used, content model, ... content attributes, ... <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> interface, ...;</p>

		<figcaption>Anatomy of an HTML Element
			<ul>
				<li><strong>The opening tag</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
				<li><strong>The closing tag</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
				<li><strong>The content</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
				<li><strong>The element</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.</li>

	<h4 id="page07">Empty Elements</h4>        
	<p>Some elements <strong>never contain content</strong>; for example <samp>br</samp>, <samp>hr</samp>, <samp>img</samp>, <samp>meta</samp>. In HTML5 specifically, we do not close empty elements (no end tag). In other markup languages, including HTML5, you can use the shorthand form, combining the start tag and end tag; for example, <samp>br /</samp> or <samp>hr /</samp></p>

&lt;!-- empty elements never take any content -->

	<h4 id="page08">Nesting Elements</h4>    
	<p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap, your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>	
    <p>Nesting represents the relations among objects in Document Object Model (DOM)</p>

	<h4 id="page11">Global attributes</h4>     
	<p>Global attributes are common to and may be specified on all HTML elements: <code>accesskey</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>contenteditable</code>, <code>dir</code>, <code>draggable</code>, <code>hidden</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>lang</code>, <code>spellcheck</code>, <code>style</code>, <code>tabindex</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>translate</code></p>
