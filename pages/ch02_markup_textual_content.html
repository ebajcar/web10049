&lt;!-- These examples show how changing the stress emphasis changes 
the meaning. First, a general statement of fact, with no stress: -->
&lt;p>Cats are cute animals.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- By emphasizing the first word, the statement implies that 
the kind of animal under discussion is in question (maybe someone 
is asserting that dogs are cute): -->
&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats&lt;/em> are cute animals.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- Moving the stress to the verb, one highlights that the truth 
of the entire sentence is in question (maybe someone is saying cats 
are not cute): -->
&lt;p>Cats &lt;em>are&lt;/em> cute animals.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- By moving it to the adjective, the exact nature of the cats 
is reasserted (maybe someone suggested cats were mean animals): -->
&lt;p>Cats are &lt;em>cute&lt;/em> animals.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- Similarly, if someone asserted that cats were vegetables, 
someone correcting this might emphasize the last word: -->
&lt;p>Cats are cute &lt;em>animals&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- By emphasizing the entire sentence, it becomes clear that 
the speaker is fighting hard to get the point across. This kind of 
stress emphasis also typically affects the punctuation, hence the 
exclamation mark here. -->
&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats are cute animals!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- Anger mixed with emphasizing the cuteness could lead to 
markup such as: -->
&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats are &lt;em>cute&lt;/em> animals!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

	<h4>Italic, bold, and underline</h4>
	<p>The elements &lt;b>, &lt;i>, and &lt;u> came about so people could write bold, italics, or underlined text in an era when CSS was still supported poorly or not at all. They only affect presentation and not semantics, are known as presentational elements and <strong>should no longer be used</strong> [<a href="https://mzl.la/35tLCHN" target="">MDN</a>], because semantics is so important to accessibility, SEO, etc.  The concept of italics isn't very helpful to people using screen readers, or to people using a writing system other than the Latin alphabet.</p>

In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem, also known as Pythagoras' 
theorem, is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the 
three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square 
whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is 
equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. 
This theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of 
the sides a, b and c, often called the &lt;q>Pythagorean equation&lt;/q>:&lt;br>

            Imagine there's no heaven
            It's easy if you try
            No hell below us
            Above us only sky
            Imagine all the people
            Living for today...

        Imagine there's no countries
          It isn't hard to do
          Nothing to kill or die for
          And no religion too
          Imagine all the people
          Living life in peace...

        You may say I'm a dreamer
        But I'm not the only one
                I hope someday you'll join us
                And the world will be as one
