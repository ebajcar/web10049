            Imagine there's no heaven
            It's easy if you try
            No hell below us
            Above us only sky
            Imagine all the people
            Living for today...

        Imagine there's no countries
          It isn't hard to do
          Nothing to kill or die for
          And no religion too
          Imagine all the people
          Living life in peace...

        You may say I'm a dreamer
        But I'm not the only one
                I hope someday you'll join us
                And the world will be as one
